OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Project: Student Grade points and Grade Calculator using java programming

Objective:
The objective of the Student Grade Tracker project is to create a Java program that calculates and tracks the grades of students across multiple subjects. The program allows users to input the number of subjects and their corresponding grades, calculates the average grade, and assigns a letter grade based on the average.

Key Activities:

1. Input Handling: The program prompts the user to enter the number of subjects and their grades using the Scanner class in Java.
2. Grade Calculation: It calculates the total grade by summing up the grades of all subjects and then computes the average grade.
3. Letter Grade Assignment: Based on the average grade, the program determines the letter grade using a predefined grading scale.
4. Output Display: It displays the average grade and the corresponding letter grade to the user.

Technologies Used:

1. Java: The project is developed using Java programming language.
2. Scanner Class: Utilized for user input handling.
3. IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Any Java IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans can be used for coding and testing.
4. Command Line Interface (CLI): The program runs in a command-line interface environment for user interaction.

Key Insights:

1. Modularity: The project demonstrates the concept of modular programming by separating the grade calculation logic into a separate method (calculateLetterGrade).
2. Conditional Statements: Conditional statements (if-else) are used to determine the letter grade based on the average grade.
3. Input Validation: The program assumes valid inputs from the user but can be extended to include input validation for robustness.
4. Scalability: The program can handle grades for any number of subjects, making it scalable for various educational scenarios.


Overall, the Student Grade Tracker provides a simple yet effective tool for calculating and assessing student grades, showcasing fundamental Java programming concepts and best practices.
